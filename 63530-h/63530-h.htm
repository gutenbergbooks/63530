<p class="indent">&#145;<span class="smcap">A Tale of Old Japan</span>&#146; is reprinted from
the &#145;Collected Poems&#146; by Alfred Noyes (Vol.

<hr class="hr2" />

<p class="center"><i>DEDICATION.</i></p>

<p><i><span class="smcap">The</span> appearance of this poem in its present
form is due chiefly to the demand created for
it by a vanished hand. It was set to music
as a cantata by Coleridge Taylor, some
years ago. He thought it his best work.
Hardly a week has passed since then without
some performance of it, in some part of the
world; and it may be said that the music
he wrote for it has won the lasting affection
of the thousands that have heard it. He
was, in two works, the most vital and
spontaneous musician of his time. The first
was his youthful setting of Longfellow&#146;s
 &#145;Hiawatha.&#146; Then came many years of
experiment with European subjects, disappointment,
and apparent failure. In the
Eastern theme of &#145;A Tale of Old Japan&#146; he
found something which (as those who know
his history will understand) enabled him to
draw the bow across his own heart-strings, and, from the first note to the last, he gave
in it the most pathetic, the most haunting
expression, to his own spirit. To me it was
a most moving fact that his great genius
should have shown so scrupulous and infinitely
painstaking a regard for the words of the
poem. He submitted to their &#147;narrow
room,&#148;  but in a way that suggests quite new
possibilities in the wedding of music and
verse. He preserved every cadence of every
line, and yet he gave the freedom of music to
the whole, in a way that poets had ceased
to think possible. It is therefore to his
memory that I would dedicate the poem, all
too poor a chrysalis as it must seem for those
exquisite wings.</i></p>

<span class="i2">&#147;Kimi,&#148;  he said, &#147;I am wedded!</span>
<span class="i4">Hush, for it could not be!&#148; </span>
<span class="i2">&#147;Kiss me one kiss,&#148;  she whispered,</span>
<span class="i4">&#147;Me also, even me.&#148; </span>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Small and terribly drifting</span>
<span class="i4">Backward, her sad white face</span>
<span class="i2">Lifted up to Sawara</span>
<span class="i4">Once, in that lonely place,</span>
<span class="i2">White as a drifting blossom</span>
<span class="i4">Under his wondering eyes,</span>
<span class="i2">Slowly he gathered and held her</span>
<span class="i4">Under the drifting skies.</span>

<span class="i2">Much impressed, Sawara straight</span>
<span class="i2">(Though the hour was growing late)</span>
<span class="i4">Made a sketch of Kimi lying</span>
<span class="i2">By the lonely, sighing sea,</span>
<span class="i4">Brought it back to Tenko.</span>
<span class="i2">Tenko looked it over crying</span>
<span class="i4">(Under the silvery willow-tree).</span>
<span class="i2">&#147;You have burst the golden gate!</span>
<span class="i2">You have conquered Time and Fate!</span>
